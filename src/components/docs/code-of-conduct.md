## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

### Step 1: Consider Direct Communication
If you feel safe and comfortable, you might:
- Politely let the person know their behavior was problematic
- Describe the impact on you or others
- Give them opportunity to understand and change

Not all situations are appropriate for this - trust your instincts.

### Step 2: Report to Maintainers
If direct communication doesn't work or isn't safe:

1. **Document the incident** - What happened, when, who was involved, any links
2. **Email the maintainers** - Send to [sast@rishihood.edu.in](mailto:sast@rishihood.edu.in) or direct message a core team member
3. **Provide context** - The more details, the better we can help
4. **Specify what you need** - Do you want mediation, someone to step back, etc.?

### Step 3: Investigation & Resolution
- We will investigate promptly and confidentially
- We'll speak with all parties involved
- We'll work toward a resolution that prioritizes safety and inclusion
- We'll follow up with you about the outcome (within reason of confidentiality)

**Timeline:** We aim to respond within 3-5 business days.

---

## Confidentiality

Reports of misconduct are handled confidentially. We will:
- ✅ Not share your identity without permission
- ✅ Only discuss the incident with people who need to know
- ✅ Protect you from retaliation
- ✅ Take your concern seriously even if unproven

---

## Consequences

We believe in accountability and growth. Depending on the severity and intent:

### Minor Issues
- Conversations and education
- Apologies or clarifications
- Temporarily stepping back from discussions

### Moderate Issues
- Suspension from community channels (1 week - 1 month)
- Requirement to apologize publicly
- Mandatory check-in before returning

### Serious Issues
- Permanent ban from SAST community
- Reporting to relevant platforms (GitHub, conference organizers, etc.)
- Public statement if appropriate

**Our goal is rehabilitation, not punishment.** We offer second chances when people show genuine commitment to change.

## Examples

### ✅ Respectful Disagreement
> "I see your point about using a library, but I'm concerned about maintenance burden. What if we explored in-house tooling? I think it could be more sustainable."

### ❌ Disrespectful Disagreement
> "That's a dumb idea. You clearly don't understand the project."

---

### ✅ Constructive Feedback
> "Great work on the component! A few suggestions: the performance could improve with memoization, and the accessibility could be enhanced with ARIA labels. Happy to pair on this!"

### ❌ Harsh Feedback
> "This code is terrible. Why would you write it like this?"

---

### ✅ Inclusive Language
> "Welcome to the team! We're excited to have you here and will support your learning."

### ❌ Exclusionary Language
> "We don't need beginners here."

---

## Special Considerations

### Online Spaces
- Text can be misinterpreted; assume good intent
- Give people benefit of the doubt
- Use emojis and tone indicators when helpful 😊
- Respond in the same communication channel as the issue

### Live Events
- We maintain inclusive, safe environments at all gatherings
- Respect people's physical boundaries
- Alcohol is permitted but not required
- Report concerns to event organizers immediately

### Mentorship & Power Dynamics
- Mentors have responsibility to maintain appropriate boundaries
- No sexual or romantic harassment
- Clear communication about mentorship scope
- Exit gracefully if relationship isn't working
